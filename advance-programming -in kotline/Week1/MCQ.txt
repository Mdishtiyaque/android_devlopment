1.
Question 1
Which option demonstrates the correct way to initialize an object in Kotlin? 

1 / 1 point

object CustomObject( )


object CustomObject { }


object CustomObject( ) { }

Correct
Correct! You use a block enclosed by a pair of curly braces that represent the object’s body.

2.
Question 2
Which option represents the correct way to call the function getNumberOfWheels defined in the object below:

1234
object Car { fun getNumberOfWheels() = 4} 
object Car {
 fun getNumberOfWheels() = 4
}


1 / 1 point

println(Car().getNumberOfWheels())


println(Car.getNumberOfWheels())


println(Car.getNumberOfWheels)

Correct
Correct! You access a member of an object simply by using the object’s name and the dot operator.

3.
Question 3
What is the correct syntax to call the function printHello defined in the code below:

1234567
class Outer {    class Nested {        fun printHello() {            println("Hello")        }    }}
class Outer {
    class Nested {
        fun printHello() {
            println("Hello")
        }
    }
}

1 / 1 point

Outer.Nested().printHello()


Outer().Nested().printHello()


Nested().printHello()

Correct
Correct! The nested class is accessed using the class name and the dot operator.

4.
Question 4
What is the correct syntax to call the function printHello defined in the code below:

12345678
class Outer {    inner class Inner {        fun printHello() {            println("Hello")        }    }} 
class Outer {
    inner class Inner {
        fun printHello() {
            println("Hello")
        }
    }
}


1 / 1 point

Outer.Inner().printHello()


Outer().Inner().printHello()


Inner().printHello()

Correct
Correct! The inner class is accessed using an instance of the outer class.

5.
Question 5
Which of these are correct ways to access the variable wheelCount in the code below:

123456
class Car {    companion object {        val wheelCount = 4    }} 
class Car {
    companion object {
        val wheelCount = 4
    }
}


0 / 1 point

Car().wheelCount


Car.companion.wheelCount

This should not be selected
Not quite. The word companion is a keyword used to define a companion object. To access a companion object of a class, use companion instead.


Car.Companion.wheelCount


Car.wheelCount

Correct
Correct. You can access the members of companion object using Classname.memberName and omit the word ‘Companion’ until companion object explicity states a name.

6.
Question 6
When should you use a companion object in a class?

1 / 1 point

To define members that should not be accessible outside the class


To define members that should be accessible by an object of a class


To define members that should be accessible without an object of a class and only using the class name

Correct
Correct. You can access the companion object using the class name without the need to have an instance of a class.

7.
Question 7
Which of the following keywords is used to declare a constant in Kotlin?

1 / 1 point

constant


const


final

Correct
Correct! You use the const keyword to declare a constant in Kotlin.

8.
Question 8
Which of these is correct if you wish to navigate from an activity called SourceActivity to another activity called  DestinationActivity in Android? 
(Assume that the Context object can be referenced using context and an instance of SourceActivity can be referenced as sourceActivity)

1 / 1 point

val intent = Intent(sourceActivity, DestinationActivity::class.java)

Correct
Correct! You can define an intent by passing the instance of calling activity (as Activity class inherits from Context class) and class reference of the activity to be started.


val intent = Intent(SourceActivity::class.java, DestinationActivity::class.java)


val intent = Intent(context, DestinationActivity::class.java)

Correct
Correct! You can define an intent by passing the context object and class reference of the activity to be started.


val intent = Intent(DestinationActivity::class.java, sourceActivity)

9.
Question 9
What is the right way to use the function startActivity to start an activity? 

1 / 1 point

context.startActivity(intent)


startActivity(context, intent) 


Activity.startActivity(intent)

Correct
Correct! You need to call the startActivity function using an instance of Context and pass an intent to the function.

10.
Question 10
Which one of the below lines can you use to pass an argument to an activity? (Assume an instance of Intent can be referenced using intent variable)

1 / 1 point

intent.getExtra(“message”, “hello”)


intent.putExtra(“hello”)


intent.putExtra(“message”, “hello”)






****************************************************************************************************

In the companion object of IngredientsActivity, you have a start function. In that function, you initialize an Intent. Which of the following calls did you use?

1 / 1 point

val intent = Intent(context, IngredientsActivity::class.java)


val intent = Intent(IngredientsActivity::class.java , context)


 val intent = Intent(context, IngredientsActivity::class)

Correct
Correct! The intent constructor expects a context followed by the Java class of the activity to start. 

2.
Question 2
In the onCreate function of the IngredientsActivity class, replace the Pasta string with Pizza. Run the code and tap the Pasta button. What happens?

1 / 1 point

IngredientsActivity launches with Unknown dish


IngredientsActivity launches with the ingredients for a pizza


IngredientsActivity no longer launches.

Correct
Correct! The Pasta argument is no longer recognized by IngredientsActivity. Any unknown argument leads to Unknown dish being presented.

3.
Question 3
Which of the following will start IngredientsActivity from MainActivity?   Select all that apply.

1 / 1 point

startActivity(Intent(this, IngredientsActivity::class.java))

Correct
Correct! You can instantiate Intent with the appropriate arguments and pass it to startActivity to start IngredientsActivity.


IngredientsActivity.start(this, “Pasta”)

Correct
Correct! Calling the static start function on IngredientsActivity will start this activity. 


startActivity(IngredientsActivity)
